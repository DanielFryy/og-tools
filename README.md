# OGame Tools - Defense and Fleet Calculator

## About the Project

OGame Tools is a personal project designed to assist players of the online game [OGame](https://ogame.org) in managing their fleets and defenses. The primary goal is to provide a simple calculator to determine the optimal number of defenses and fleet units to rebuild after an attack, ensuring a balanced and proportional setup.

This tool is highly opinionated and tailored for personal use, starting with static values based on the server I play on. Future updates may include more dynamic features to accommodate different servers and configurations.

### Supported servers

- Undae

## Motivation

As an avid OGame player, I often find myself rebuilding my defenses and fleet after attacks. To maintain a consistent and proportional setup, I rely on calculations to determine the exact number of units to build. This project aims to simplify that process and save time by automating these calculations.

## Features

- **Defense Calculator**: Helps calculate the number of defenses to build based on a predefined proportion.
- **Fleet Management**: Ensures a balanced ratio between fleet and defenses.
- **Round Number Calculations**: Provides results in round numbers for simplicity and ease of use.

## Future Plans

- Add dynamic configurations to support different servers and playstyles.
- Expand functionality to include additional tools for OGame players.
- Improve the user interface for a more seamless experience.
